# Gradle vs Maven: Build Tool Comparison

| Feature                | Maven                                 | Gradle                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Build Language         | XML (pom.xml)                         | Groovy/Kotlin DSL (build.gradle)       |
| Performance            | Slower (especially for large builds)  | Faster (incremental builds, daemon)    |
| Dependency Management  | Mature, central repository            | Mature, supports Maven/Ivy repos       |
| Build Customization    | Convention over configuration         | Highly customizable via scripting      |
| IDE Support            | Excellent (all major IDEs)            | Excellent (all major IDEs)             |
| Plugin Ecosystem       | Large, stable                         | Growing, very flexible                 |
| Wrapper Support        | Yes (mvnw)                            | Yes (gradlew)                          |
| Multi-module Projects  | Supported                             | Supported                              |
| Build Output           | Standardized (target/)                | Flexible (build/)                      |
| Learning Curve         | Easier for beginners                  | Steeper, but more powerful             |

## Can You Use Both Maven and Gradle in One Project?

While it is technically possible to include both Maven and Gradle build files in a single repository (e.g., `pom.xml` and `build.gradle`), **it is not recommended to use both tools to build the same module or artifact**. This can lead to confusion, duplicated configuration, and inconsistent builds.

**Common scenarios where both may exist:**
- During migration from Maven to Gradle (or vice versa), both build files may temporarily coexist.
- In a multi-module repository, some modules may use Maven and others Gradle, but this increases maintenance complexity.

**Best Practice:**  
Choose one build tool per project or module for clarity and maintainability.

## When to Use Maven

- You prefer convention over configuration.
- Your team is already familiar with Maven.
- You want a stable, mature ecosystem.

## When to Use Gradle

- You need faster builds and incremental compilation.
- You require advanced build customizations.
- You prefer a more modern, scriptable build tool.
